#### Description
This course is organized to teach the aesthetics and fundamentals of motion and its application to design and media arts through an introduction of the basic concepts and tools for the design of moving images. In a series of assignments and a final project, students will explore principles and aesthetics of moving imagery including timing, pacing, repetition, editing, composition, resolution, process, and the link between sound and image. Class time will include class discussions, student presentations, software and equipment tutorials and studio time for project development.

####  Evaluation
Students will complete three projects, a sound/image exercise, and a larger final project. Projects will be evaluated based on aesthetic and conceptual qualities, innovative approach to the medium, and effort. All projects must be completed in order to pass the course. Late assignments will reduce the numeric score of the assignment. Assignments are only considered complete when accessible from the course website.

Attendance is mandatory. Absences require professor notification and permission. If a student is late 3 times, this will count as an unexcused absence and will affect your grade. Your participation and presentation skills will be considered in grading.
